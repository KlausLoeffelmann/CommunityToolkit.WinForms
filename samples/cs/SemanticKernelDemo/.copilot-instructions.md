* While you should always consider brief results, do not shy away from longer code, when the context requires it.
* Always include to add Win32 P/Invoke declarations, when using P/Invoke.
* Consider one-lined simplified `using` and `namespace` statements.
* Consider nullable reference types to be always enabled. 
  Especially, when you insert event handler, consider the type `object?` 
  for the sender.`
* Prefer pattern matching where possible.
* Use expression-bodied members for simple methods and properties, both for getters and setters, where possible.
* Always consider amending code, meaning, do not omit existing code in results.
* Consider "is null" and "is not null" patterns for null checks.
* Prefer switch expressions, where it makes sense.
* Use concrete type declarations over `var`.
