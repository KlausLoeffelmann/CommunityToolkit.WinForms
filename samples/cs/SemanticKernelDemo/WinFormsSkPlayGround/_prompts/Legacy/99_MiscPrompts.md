RTD Demo Strings:

```
Can you generate a method in C#, which returns a string, which resembles an 
RTF text of "Lore Ipsum" that shows off the various formatting options of RTF features?
```

```
I want to create a WinForms "AI-Prompt-Control" which has a render-logic for a clickable "prompt-send" icon inside this Prompt Control. I don't want this to be a composite control but inherit from TextBox. It should be a Multiline control. Here, I do not want to render the symbol inside of OnPaint as part of the client-content rendering, but rather implement something to render in the context of system elements more safely. Can you write the code for such a control, with a non-client paint logic for that and include a method for the rendering of the symbol right aligned in the control in the height of the text cursor? Can you paint the symbol 20 pixel < control.Right and in the height of the last line of the textbox?
```
